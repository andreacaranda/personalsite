            Last summer, my friends and I tried to learn to code on our own, and
            we got a basic understanding of tags, HTML, and CSS. But, we wanted
            to learn more. So, that's when we found out about Girls Who Code! I
            didn't know what to expect at first, since this was all very new.
            I'm so glad I stuck with it, since I got to create and learn new
            things. I also really like how there's always more to learn to
            further my skills.

            After I learned HTML and CSS, I started trying to learn Python as
            well, this school year. In my opinion Python is harder, since
            there's a lot more to it - with loops, arrays, lists, and more. I'm
            definetly getting better at it, but I still need to practice. Just
            like anything else, the more I do it, the better I get.
